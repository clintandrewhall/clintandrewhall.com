# TODO

- Move images to async
- Masonry image grids in portfolio entries
- Refactor `registerHomeSection`, it's a bit gnarly.

- [@react/spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/)
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/)
- https://github.com/noamr/use-view-transitions
- Consider TOC for portfolio posts.
- Consider parallax for portfolio post cover images.
- Consider portfolio listing from grid to image and description
- Consider moving from Helmet to portal (tough for CSS-In-JS without effort)
