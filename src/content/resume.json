    "summary": "I'm an Engineering Lead and User Interface Engineer.  I work to make the web beautiful, both on its surface and beneath.\n\nI'm a demonstrated expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, React/Flux/Relay, and more.  I specialize in techniques promoting web agnostics, semantics, and accessibility.  I'm comfortable with varying levels of skill in any web full stack, having written and maintained production code in JS, PHP, Java and Ruby-on-Rails.  I currently prefer React+Node or React Native for most of my personal projects.\n\nI'm a regular consumer and occasional contributor to open source projects and client APIs.  If I have a suggestion for a website or application, I prefer to demonstrate the idea using an API rather than just describe it-- Code Wins Arguments.\n\nI look for opportunities where I can make strong, direct and meaningful contributions to a team, to users and to the web. I'm comfortable functioning as both designer and engineer, advising on both the technical and aesthetic.  I'm affable and good-natured, yet results-driven and competitive.  I have extensive experience working remotely, particularly during my time at Facebook and Elastic.",
