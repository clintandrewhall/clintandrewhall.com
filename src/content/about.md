I craft them for desktop and mobile browsers, professionally and in my spare time. I'm incredibly fortunate that my passion became my career.

I pursue them, too. I enjoy conferences like [SxSW](http://sxsw.com/), gatherings like [TED](https://www.ted.com/) and [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7658), and hackathons like [Startup Weekend](https://www.techstars.com/communities/startup-weekend). I love to [build](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bggec_FA6m0/) with Lego. I made my own [desk](https://www.instagram.com/p/qOJJTcFmOr/). I tinker with [hardware](https://www.instagram.com/p/uMRGZVlmDx/) and [VR](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMhqanBBoGD/). If I'm not [traveling the world](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGLyaiZFmFg) with my wife, [Olivia](https://www.instagram.com/p/3pb4fslmN-/), you might find me [onstage](https://www.instagram.com/p/Rl_ij5lmOc/) in community theatre, or [telling a story](https://www.instagram.com/p/BX80pE0BmcO/) at [The Moth](http://themoth.org). I'm also the father of two beautiful children.

I'm currently the Technical Lead for the Global Experience team within [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) at [Elastic](https://elastic.co), working from my home in Hamilton, ON.

In the past, I've worked for Facebook, Cerner, Sprint and Accenture, and lived in New York, Vancouver and San Francisco.  My hometown is Kansas City, MO. So far we've visited 44 countries, (and counting).
