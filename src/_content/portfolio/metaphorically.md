# Background

While I was living in Vancouver, BC, TEDxRenfrewCollingwood announced a call for
presentations. I've always been interested in how people perceive technology,
particularly tech people usually don't understand. I've [written
before](https://medium.com/@clintandrewhall/neither-sorcery-nor-alchemy-304691d1fb7c)
about it, so I decided to
[audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27t9pvCVef4) with [a few
notes](https://medium.com/@clintandrewhall/neither-sorcerers-nor-alchemists-80b7cd66ce15)
from my previous writings.

I argued that because software engineers, (and, moreso, salespeople), offer
their wares in "magical" terms, it's becoming more and more impossible for
people to remain safe and productive. We often use new gadgets and systems
without really understanding how they work, what they're storing about us, how
to stay private and safe, etc.

In short, technology understanding people has trumped people understanding
technology. And what is art and science has become sorcery and alchemy.

I was [accepted to
speak](http://tedxrenfrewcollingwood.com/speaker-2014/clint-hall) and quickly
set to work honing a talk that would speak to this concept, but also try to
solve the problem in some way.

# Results

I created an [open-source
project](https://github.com/clintandrewhall/metaphorically) called
"[metaphorical.ly](http://metaphorical.ly/)", which gathers metaphors from geeks
all over the world to explain obtuse technological concepts to anyone interested
in knowing how they work. I then prepared and gave my talk at
TEDxRenfrewCollingwood.
