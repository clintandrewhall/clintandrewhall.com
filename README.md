I got tired of Wordpress and rolled my own portfolio site.  It serves as a portfolio both as a website and as source code.

The content is sourced from a single JSON file.  I use it to generate a dynamic and static site, as well as resumes in a bunch of popular formats.

Now I just need to write an entry for this portfolio repo in... my portfolio. ðŸ˜†
