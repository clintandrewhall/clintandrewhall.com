<p>I attended <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">SxSW</a> in 2010, for the third time. As always,
there were a ton of things to see and do... but I found myself remembering
places from past trips to Austin. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;where was that one place we went on Friday last year, with the <strong>____</strong></li>
<li>and the <strong>____</strong>? Did we go to the <strong>____</strong>-sponsored talk last time?</li>
<li>Where was that awesome restaurant where we met <strong>____</strong>?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>With FOMO on my mind, those questions inevitably got answered, usually after a
lot of painful searching through memory, anecdote, blog and social media.</p>
<p>One night of the conference, I was wandering through Austin (keeping a weather
eye open for my next awesome experience), when I saw a <em>very</em> large group
gathering in the lobby of the Hilton.</p>
<p>I checked my Twitter feed, and I saw <a href="http://denniscrowley.com/">Dennis Crowley</a>
of Foursquare had been tweeting
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dens/status/47559270732009472">cryptic</a>
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dens/status/47539944884932609">messages</a> hinting toward
some kind of &quot;swimming&quot; event.</p>
<p>I discovered that, every year at SxSW, the Foursquare guys would lie on their
backs and race across the lobby floor pushing with their feet and a making a
backstroking motion with their arms. It was hilarious.</p>
<p>Inspired by the shenanigans, I decided I would build a &quot;memory&quot; tool for social
media, and I would call it &quot;Backstrokes&quot;... allowing people to &quot;swim back&quot;
through their history.</p>
<h1>The Project</h1>
<p><a href="http://backstrok.es/">Backstrok.es</a> currently has one facet, the one that was
the most interesting to me at the time: trips to other cities. Using a home zip
code, Backstrok.es will organize checkins within a certain range of each other
into &quot;trips&quot;, making it easy to list and recall the places you’ve been.</p>
<p>The code is now <a href="https://github.com/clintandrewhall/backstrok.es">open-source</a>
on <a href="https://github.com/clintandrewhall">my Github</a>.  I update it as I have time.</p>

<p>Backstrok.es is built on Node.JS. It uses my

library for working with the Swarm and Foursquare APIs. As a point of pride (and
to keep the hosting free), it uses no database: all data is retrieved and
organized on each page load.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future I’ll use a database for &quot;sharing&quot; trips with your friends.
But for now, it's a useful tool when friends of mine are looking for
recommendations in cities I've visited.</p>

<p>In 2010 I volunteered to help organize Party Arty, the annual fundraising event
for the Young Friends of Art for the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City. During
the planning, it occurred to me that there was an opportunity to experiment with
some art of my own: displaying live pictures taken that evening.</p>
<p>My feature list was extensive (and a bit challenging): since we would have
several photographers on site taking photos, I decided to use Eye-Fi cards to
upload those photos to a server as they were taken. Once stored and processed,
we could use a web interface on an iPad/iPhone to approve photos and send them
to the photo wall.</p>
<h1>2010 Version</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZLN7TtUVx4">Watch a Video Demo</a></p>
<p>As it turned out, the Eye-Fi cards on the museum’s wireless network were slow
getting photos to the server. With a bit of behind-the-scenes live-hacking, I
was able to use the photographers' memory cards directly to get new photos up on
the wall. Event organizers and attendees absolutely loved it!</p>
<h1>2015 Version</h1>
<p>My Photo Wall kept evolving for various friends' events until, in 2015, I had an
event of my own: my wedding to my wife, Olivia.</p>
<p>By then, I had been working for Facebook for three years. It occurred to me that
I could source the photos from a Facebook Event or Group far easier than
coordinate downloading images from a card or phone... plus, I could make it
refresh the moment it was posted!</p>
<p>I refactored and open-sourced the code to it's current iteration: a
live-updating display of photos posted to a Facebook wall. It doesn't even
require a server: the page is static and can be run from a hard drive or
Dropbox.</p>

<h1>Colophon</h1>
<p>The first version was a full-screen instance of Chrome using CSS3 transitions
and animations to display the normalized photos. Using Node’s async nature, I
was able to process photos very quickly, (I even experimented with facial
recognition to properly “center” faces!). I used Socket.io to create real-time
posts to the wall– essentially, the admins approvals on the iPad or iPhone would
“fly up” into the “Recent Photos” queue beneath the display.</p>
<p>The second version removed all of those dependencies, opting instead for a
polling call to a Facebook GraphQL URL. The creator need only issue themselves
a long-access token and specify the Facebook ID of the Event they want to
display.</p>

<p>In 2010, I signed up for the first annual <a href="http://www.nodeknockout.com/">Node
Knockout</a>, a 48-hour coding competition where
teams of up to 4 people could create any app they wanted on the Node.JS server.
It was a lot of fun, and I learned <em>a lot</em> about Node… but we definitely bit off
more than we could chew. With lessons learned and more time in the Node world, I
was raring to go for Node Knockout 2011.</p>
<p>I recruited what my friends called a &quot;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/clintandrewhall/status/107130172192473088">Dream
Team</a>&quot; of
geeks: designer <a href="http://www.twitter.com/designbyjm">Jacob McDaniel</a> and
developers <a href="http://www.twitter.com/whereisciao">Steven Chau</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codegrappler">Mike
Hemesath</a>. After many Monday Geek Night
hashing out what we would build, we decided on a classic childhood game that had
yet to be recreated in the social media space: <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/guess-who/">Guess
Who</a>.</p>

<p>We knew from talking to our friends and fellow geeks that using mutual Facebook
friends as the “tiles” would give us the greatest traction, (and the most fun
gaming experience). We also decided to use <a href="http://www.pusher.com/">Pusher</a> to
give it some async love. Jacob tackled the user experience and I took on most of
the core experience code. Mike and Steven took on the new Pusher API and some of
the custom Connect middleware. Mike also served as our deployment ninja, keeping
our Heroku instance healthy and happy. Steven even got a custom cache out on
Amazon for the Facebook images.</p>

<p>In the end, <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/teams/kansas-city-geek-nig">our entry</a>
ended up in the top 10% of entries in <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/entries">all
categories</a>. Judges and users alike loved the
design and concept, and our friends were delighted to play. Had we had more
time, we could have gotten a lot more done: notifications, mobile, invites, etc.

<p>While I was living in Vancouver, BC, TEDxRenfrewCollingwood announced a call for
presentations. I've always been interested in how people perceive technology,
particularly tech people usually don't understand. I've <a href="https://medium.com/@clintandrewhall/neither-sorcery-nor-alchemy-304691d1fb7c">written
before</a>
about it, so I decided to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27t9pvCVef4">audition</a> with <a href="https://medium.com/@clintandrewhall/neither-sorcerers-nor-alchemists-80b7cd66ce15">a few
notes</a>
from my previous writings.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/27t9pvCVef4?t=29s" title="My TEDx Audition"><img src="/images/portfolio/metaphorically-4.jpg" alt="My TEDx Audition" /></a></p>
<p>I argued that because software engineers, (and, moreso, salespeople), offer
their wares in &quot;magical&quot; terms, it's becoming more and more impossible for
people to remain safe and productive. We often use new gadgets and systems
without really understanding how they work, what they're storing about us, how
to stay private and safe, etc.</p>
<p>In short, technology understanding people has trumped people understanding
technology. And what is art and science has become sorcery and alchemy.</p>
<p>I was <a href="http://tedxrenfrewcollingwood.com/speaker-2014/clint-hall">accepted to
speak</a> and quickly
set to work honing a talk that would speak to this concept, but also try to
solve the problem in some way.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>I created an <a href="https://github.com/clintandrewhall/metaphorically">open-source
project</a> called
&quot;<a href="http://metaphorical.ly/">metaphorical.ly</a>&quot;, which gathers metaphors from geeks
all over the world to explain obtuse technological concepts to anyone interested
in knowing how they work. I then prepared and gave my talk at

<p>I was getting ready to build
<a href="http://www.clintandrewhall.com/portfolio/backstrokes">Backstrok.es</a>, but I
realized I needed a solid Foursquare library. Looking around, I noticed there
were few implementations, and most either were abandoned or lacked access to the
endpoints I needed. So I decided to fork an existing library,
<a href="https://github.com/yikulju/Foursquare-on-node">Foursquare-on-node</a>, and add
functionality.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I refactored the fork well beyond a simple pull request. After
contacting <a href="https://github.com/yikulju">the author</a>, I applied an MIT license
and released my node-foursquare library in the <a href="http://www.npmjs.org/">npmjs</a>
repository for Node. It is currently
<a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/libraries.html">listed</a> on the
<a href="http://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare Developer site</a> as the only
library for using Foursquare within Node.</p>
<p><img src="/images/portfolio/node-foursquare-2.jpg" alt="Two" />
<img src="/images/portfolio/node-foursquare-3.jpg" alt="Three" /></p>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Since the Foursquare API is
<a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/index_docs.html">well-documented</a>, I was
able to quickly add all “getter” endpoints to the library. There seems to be
little demand for the “setter” endpoints at the moment, in the Node context.</p>
<h1>Colophon</h1>
<p>This library conforms to <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/overview.html">Foursquare API
v2</a> and uses
<a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">winston</a> as a logging strategy. It has
great <a href="https://github.com/clintandrewhall/node-foursquare">configuration
options</a>, such as warnings
vs. errors on deprecated endpoints and targeting specific API changelog numbers.
I currently use it in my

<p>In 2009, I was asked to serve as Presentation Architect for a very ambitious
project at Cerner known as “Healthe”. I was tasked with bringing the forthcoming
web solutions level with the rest of the industry: semantic markup, high levels
of accessibility, mobile, low bandwidth, etc.</p>
<p>I set straight to work, rapidly iterating on static HTML prototypes of visual
designs and putting them in front of stakeholders. I wrote a great deal of code
in that time, and I began to think of ways we could better leverage this highly
semantic, viewable-in-Lynx web code. My thought was, if we adhered to this
strict Progressive Enhancement model, could we simply “re-skin” our HTML code
passively for any device?</p>
<p>What followed was the implementation of what I called a “Web Bootstrapper”,
where immutable properties of the web client are provided to a server-side
process (e.g. rules engine) in order to determine the best collection of static
resources for that client. While some presentation flexing tools download all
front-end code and flex based on client attributes, the Bootstrapper returned
only those items that are necessary. In addition, it allowed for runtime
configuration, where skins can be “shut off” or added at will.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>As a side project within Cerner, my Web Bootstrapper didn’t get much attention
until it hit production on our Personal Health Record (PHR) and Activity
Tracking prototype. I was able to demonstrate I could take the oldest mobile
device in the room, (some scarily obsolete!) and load my PHR quickly and, most
importantly, consistently. Shortly thereafter, teams began using it to flex
their PE muscle in all kinds of ways.</p>
